Q1. Write a program that will create a Class ‘Car’ and its fields like; CarModel, CarName, CarPrice
and CarOwner. The program should include functions to assign values to the above mentioned fields and a display function to show the values


Q2. Print the average of three numbers by creating a class named 'Average' having a method to calculate and print the average

Q3. Print the sum, difference and product of two numbers by creating a class
named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation and numbers will be passed while function calling

Q4. Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary of employee.
1 - 'getInfo()' this method will take (a) name of the employee (b) hourly rate and (c) total working hours in a month as parameter and will do assignment
2 - ‘printSalary()’ this method will print the emoloyee’s monthly salary along with employee name

Q5 Create a class 'Student' with three data members which are name, age and address.
The constructor of the class assigns default values to name as "unknown", age as '0' and address as "not available". 
Student class has a function 'setInfo' and it takes 3 optional parameters for name, age and and address and it assigns the values to the class properties.
Create 3 objects of class student and print the name, age and address of 3 students.

Q6. Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number (think about it)
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters respectively in ints constructors and print their areas.

Q7. Suppose you have an account in ‘Meezan Bank’ with an initial amount of PKR 500 and you have to add some more amount to it.
Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value of PKR 500. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Meezan Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Meezan Bank. Then create an object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in the Meezan Bank.

Q8. Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, then in place of "programming languages" the name of that String variable should be printed.
For example, while creating the object if we pass "c++", then "I love c++" should be printed.

Q9. Create a Time Class with three fields to store hr, min and seconds. Create a constructors to initialize values to the fields and apply checks to assign a valid time e.g Minutes can’t exceeded by 60. Also create a “displayTime” function which will display the time

Q10. Create a class for each real-world object in your daily life that can have some properties and some functions. There should be at-least 5 classes. For example i can create a class for my Smartphone:
A smartphone has properties/fields like Brand Name, Model, Year, Storage, RAM, Screen Size and functions like makeAndReceiveCalls, textMessages, takePicture, navigation, playMusic, recordAudio and a lot of others.
In the same way, you have to create all possible classes from your daily life objects (the things around you), set a descriptive name, create all possible constructors/parameterised-constructors & all possible functions. Make their objects in main method and call the functions and print something on the console.
